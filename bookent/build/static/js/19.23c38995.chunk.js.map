One of the major reasons\r\n                    is the invention of smartphones and other Internet-based devices which makes books easily\r\n                    available. However, many people still prefer physical books to digital ones since the former\r\n                    cause more concentration and fewer headaches. We developed an application to encourage\r\n                    people to revive the reading habit using physical books. Our application simplifies the\r\n                    process of reading physical books. The application is really very helpful for the reader as\r\n                    they can swap books instead of buying and wasting money. <br /><br />\r\n                </h4>\r\n\r\n                <h4 style={{ fontSize: 2.5 + 'vmin' }}>\r\n                    The main intention of this project is to make books swapping easier and more active for all\r\n                    ages in our society. The idea is a simple, bring books and swap them at a local community.\r\n                    It would create a great way for people to meet and share reviews and pass on their reads to\r\n                    a new audience. As a result, the book readers will be increased, and their knowledge can\r\n                    be shared.
